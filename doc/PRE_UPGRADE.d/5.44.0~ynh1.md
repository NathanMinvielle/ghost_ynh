Starting v5.44.0~ynh1, the package relies on Ghost CLI to manage the installation of the app.

The migration has been tested, though please report any issue you might encounter.
You might need to manually move your `content` directory to its proper location in `__INSTALL_DIR__/ghost/content`.
Remember that a backup is performed before any app upgrade by your YunoHost server.

Enjoy!
